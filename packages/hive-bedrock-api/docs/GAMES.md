# Game statistics types

When fetching a monthly or all-time leaderboards or statistics, the returned objects will have the below structures per game.
When fetching a specific player's statistics, one object will be returned for each game statistics were fetched for; when fetching a leaderboard, one object for each player, all with the same structure (as they belong to the same game).
Fields which are only present in _All-Time statistics_, _Monthly statistics_, or _Leaderboards_ are marked as such.
